# Change Log

## 0.0.4 - TBD

* Fixed bug where folding was not provided on an untitled/yet-to-be-saved editor even if the language was set to `daily-bullet-notes`
* Added auto completion options when cursor is within a `[ ]` box
  * This can be triggered normally via `Ctrl + Space`
  * Or, if you mouse click within the box, auto complete will pop up automatically, and the symbol within the box will be selected so you can easily change it

## 0.0.3 - 2024-12-5

* Fixed bug where `[x]` or `[-]` sub-tasks were not removed on next day
* `[ ]` is now highlighted just like `[]`
* Added [New DBM File](command:daily-bullet-notes.newFile) command which will create a new file with a template to get new users started
* Readme updates to get new users started

## 0.0.2 - 2024-12-3

* Updated readme with extension overview
* Progress/blocked/etc markers are removed from task boxes when copied to today so your new day starts with a clean slate

## 0.0.1 - 2024-12-1

* Initial version - not yet complete, many bugs
